I tried to make custom validation for gmail part. 

I wanted features like-
    1. @gmail.com is the only valid extention
    2. there should be a mix of digits and characters before '@'
    3. special characters restriction (except '.')

However, anyone who wants to do it and help with that to my project is welcome.
